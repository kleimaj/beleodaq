            <p class="indications__body copyright">BELEODAQ is a histone deacetylase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate and duration of response. An improvement in survival or disease-related symptoms has not been established. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon veriﬁcation and description of clinical beneﬁt in the conﬁrmatory trial.</p>

            <h5 class="primary">Warnings and Precautions</h5>
            <p><span class="semibold">Hematologic Toxicity:</span> BELEODAQ can cause thrombocytopenia, leukopenia (neutropenia and lymphopenia), and/or anemia; monitor blood counts weekly during treatment and modify dosage as necessary.</p>
            <p><span class="semibold">Infections:</span> Serious and sometimes fatal infections, including pneumonia and sepsis, have occurred with BELEODAQ. Do not administer BELEODAQ to patients with an active infection. Patients with a history of extensive or intensive chemotherapy may be at a higher risk of life-threatening infections.</p>
            <p><span class="semibold">Hepatotoxicity:</span> BELEODAQ can cause fatal hepatotoxicity and liver function test abnormalities. Monitor liver function tests before treatment and before the start of each cycle. Interrupt or adjust dosage until recovery, or permanently discontinue BELEODAQ based on the severity of the hepatic toxicity.</p>
            <p><span class="semibold">Tumor Lysis Syndrome:</span> Tumor lysis syndrome has occurred in BELEODAQ-treated patients in the clinical trial of patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL. Monitor patients with advanced stage disease and/or high tumor burden, and take appropriate precautions.</p>
            <p><span class="semibold">Gastrointestinal Toxicity:</span> Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea occur with BELEODAQ and may require the use of antiemetic and antidiarrheal medications.</p>
            <p><span class="semibold">Embryo-Fetal Toxicity:</span> BELEODAQ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with BELEODAQ and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BELEODAQ and for 3 months after the last dose.</p>

            <h5 class="primary">Adverse Reactions</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>The most common adverse reactions observed in more than 25% of patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL in the trial, who were treated with BELEODAQ, were nausea (42%), fatigue (37%), pyrexia (35%), anemia (32%), and vomiting (29%).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Sixty-one patients (47.3%) experienced serious adverse reactions while taking BELEODAQ or within 30 days after their last dose of BELEODAQ. The most common serious adverse reactions (>2%) were pneumonia, pyrexia, infection, anemia, increased creatinine, thrombocytopenia, and multi-organ failure.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h5 class="primary">Drug Interactions</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>BELEODAQ is primarily metabolized by UGT1A1. Avoid concomitant administration of BELEODAQ with strong inhibitors of UGT1A1.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
