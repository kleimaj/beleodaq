        <p class="light"><span class="semibold">Infections:</span> Serious and sometimes fatal infections, including pneumonia and sepsis, have occurred with BELEODAQ.

Monitor liver function tests before treatment and before the start of each cycle. Interrupt or adjust dosage until recovery, or permanently discontinue BELEODAQ based on the severity of the hepatic toxicity.</p>
        <p class="light"><span class="semibold">Tumor Lysis Syndrome:</span> Tumor lysis syndrome has occurred in BELEODAQ-treated patients in the clinical trial of patients with relapsed or refractory PTCL. Monitor patients with advanced stage disease and/or high tumor burden, and take appropriate precautions.</p>
        <p class="light"><span class="semibold">Gastrointestinal Toxicity:</span> Nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea occur with BELEODAQ and may require the use of antiemetic and antidiarrheal medications.</p>
        <p class="light"><span class="semibold">Embryo-Fetal Toxicity:</span> BELEODAQ can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Advise pregnant women of the risk to a fetus. Advise females of reproductive potential to use an effective method of contraception during treatment with BELEODAQ and for 6 months after the last dose. Advise males with female partners of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with BELEODAQ and for 3 months after the last dose.</p>
