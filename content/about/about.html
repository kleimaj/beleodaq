    <h2 class="primary">BELEODAQ Is a Pan-HDAC Inhibitor FDA Approved for R/R PTCL</h2>
    <h3 class="secondary-variant">Although the exact MOA of HDAC inhibitors is still being studied, BELEODAQ is believed to work as follows:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4 class="light">
                HDACs catalyze the removal of acetyl groups from the lysine residues of histones, which promotes a closed chromatin structure. HDACs also remove acetyl groups from some nonhistone proteins<sup>7,8</sup>
            </h4>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 class="light">
                In vitro, BELEODAQ inhibits the enzymatic activity of HDACs at nanomolar concentrations (&lt;250 nM). This causes accumulation of acetylated histones and nonhistone proteins, which can promote an open chromatin structure<sup>1,8</sup>
            </h4>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4 class="light">
                BELEODAQ induces cell-cycle arrest and/or apoptosis of some transformed cells. BELEODAQ shows preferential cytotoxicity toward tumor cells compared to normal cells<sup>1</sup>
